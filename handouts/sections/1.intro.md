# Introduction

This tutorial is designed for people with very little or no knowledge
of dataflow programming and/or hardware architectures. You should have
already seen a short demo explaining the Maxeler tool-chain and solved
a simple training exercises to familiarise yourself with the
development flow.

In this tutorial, we will be working our way towards a hardware
architecture for multiplying small matrices (up to 16 x 16
elements). We will:

1. build a simple architecture for vector-vector
   multiplication
2. extend this to a matrix-vector multiplier
3. and finally, a matrix-matrix multiplier

__Note__ Each exercise builds on the previous one(s). Make sure you get
the first ones right! There is plenty of time and don't be shy to ask
for help.

In your MaxIDE you should see three skeleton projects, one for each
step above. These provide boilerplate code for generating input and
checking and printing the output. Each file (for CPU Code, Manager and
Kernel) has a _TODO_ which briefly describes what you should add.

# Vector-Vector Multiplier

We will start by building a simple vector-vector multiplier.
<!-- If $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are our vectors, then you should implement: -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- dot = 0 -->
<!-- for i = 0, i < n, i++ -->
<!--    dot += a[i] * b[i] -->
<!-- output dot -->
<!-- ``` -->

The first step would be to build the design shown in Figure 1.a.
This design takes one input per clock cycle. Note that you will have
to _reduce the results on the CPU side_.

  per clock cycle, b) fully unrolled design}
  \label{fig:vector-vector}
\end{figure}


__Exercise 1.1__ Build a vector-vector multiplier which produces one
value per clock cycle as shown in Figure 1.a.


Now let's exploit the on-chip resources to increase the level of
parallelism.
In your implementation you can use a DFEVector<DFEVar>, which (as the
name suggests) is a _vector_ of data streams.

We can define a vector type as shown below:

```
DFEVectorType<DFEVar> vectorType = new DFEVectorType>(scalarType, N)
```

where _scalarType_ is the type of one input stream and _N_ is the
number of streams.

We can read a vector of data as shown below:

```
DFEVector<DFE> in = io.input("inputName", vectorType)
```

__Exercise 1.2__ Using a DFEVector, implement the design shown in Figure 1.b.


# Matrix-Vector Multiplier

Let's extend the vector-vector multiplier we built to a matrix-vector
multiplier.

One approach is to:

1. Store the vector on chip

2. Stream the matrix row by row

We can use a controlled input to select on which _kernel cycle_ we
want to read from the stream. The syntax for controlled inputs is:

```
DFEVar in = io.input("inputName", type, enable)
```

where _enable_ is the boolean stream which controlls the output. In a
given cycle, new input will be read if and only if _enable_ is set to
1 (or true). If _enable_ is set to 0 (or false), the previously read
value will be preserved.

We can use a controlled input to create an on-chip cache, by only
enabling the input for the first cycle. To create a counter which
counts up to _maximumValue_ and then wraps to 0 use the following MaxJ
construct:

```
DFEVar count = control.count.simpleCounter(counterBitWidth, maximumValue)
```

\end{figure}


__Exercise 2.1__ Using counters and controlled inputs, implement the
matrix-vector multiplier described above (and also in Figure
\ref{fig:matrix-vector}). _Hint_ To simplify the implementation,
consider transposing the matrix on the CPU, before streaming it to the
DFE.

  \caption{Fully unrolled design for matrix vector multiplication.}
  \label{fig:matrix-vector-full}
\end{figure}


__Exercise 2.2__ Implement a fully unrolled matrix-vector multiplier,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:matrix-vector-full}.  _Hint_ Your design
should take all matrix and vector values as input and produce the
result in a single _kernel cycle_.

# Matrix-Matrix Multiplier

You should, by now, be familiar with all the concepts required to
extend the matrix-vector multiplier from exercise 2.2 to a fully
unrolled matrix-matrix multiplier.

__Exercise 2.3__ Implement a fully unrolled matrix-matrix multiplier.
